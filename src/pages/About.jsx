            Hello! I'm Hannu, a passionate full-stack developer with a focus on back-end. My main experience is with .NET (C#) and Javascript to customize Dynamics 365. However, I have recently been diving into front-end development using React and Vite to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

          <p>
            More specifically my expertise has been on Microsoft Dynamcis 365 / Azure development and customization. I have experience in building custom solutions, plugins, and integrations to enhance business processes and workflows. Through that I have some experience with Javascript, which led me to explore front-end development further.
